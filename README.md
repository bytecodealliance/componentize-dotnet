Simplifying C# wasm components 

**A [Bytecode Alliance](https://bytecodealliance.org/) hosted project**

If you have any questions of problems feel free to reach out on the  [c# zulip chat](https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/407028-C.23.2F.2Enet-collaboration).

## Purpose

This is to simplify using Wasm components in c#.

Without this package, if you wanted to build a WASI 0.2 component with .NET, including using WIT imports/exports, there are several different tools you'd need to discover, download, configure, and manually chain together. Just figuring out which versions of each are compatible with the others is a big challenge. Working out how to get started would be very painful.

With this package, you can add one NuGet reference. The build output is fully AOT compiled and is known to work in recent versions of wasmtime and WAMR.

:construction: All the underlying technologies are under heavy development and are missing features. Please try to file it on the relevant underlying [tool](#credits) if relevant to that tool.

## Getting started

**Limitation**: Although the resulting `.wasm` files can run on any OS, [the compiler itself is currently limited to Windows](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/issues/1890#issuecomment-1221602595). 

### 1. Set up SDKs

If you don't already have it, install [.NET 8+ SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)

### 2. Create a project and add ByteCodeAlliance.Componentize.DotNet.Wasm.SDK package

* `dotnet new console -o MyApp`
* `cd MyApp`
* `dotnet add package ByteCodeAlliance.Componentize.DotNet.Wasm.SDK --prerelease`

### 3. Configure the compilation output

Edit the `.csproj` file, adding the following inside the `<PropertyGroup>`:

```xml
    <RuntimeIdentifier>wasi-wasm</RuntimeIdentifier>
    <UseAppHost>false</UseAppHost>
    <PublishTrimmed>true</PublishTrimmed>
    <InvariantGlobalization>true</InvariantGlobalization>
```

Now you can `dotnet build` to produce a `.wasm` file using NativeAOT compilation.

### 4. Run the WebAssembly binary

If you have a recent version of [wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases) on your path, you can now run

    wasmtime bin\Debug\net8.0\wasi-wasm\native\MyApp.wasm

(if needed, replace `MyApp.wasm` with the actual name of your project)

## Creating a WASI 0.2 component, including WIT support

This is much more advanced and is likely to break frequently, since the underlying tool ecosystem is continually changing.

The compilation above will also have generated `MyApp.component.wasm`, which is a WASI 0.2 component. You can also run that if you want, using `wasmtime --wasm component-model bin\Debug\net8.0\wasi-wasm\native\MyApp.component.wasm`.

**Troubleshooting:** If you get an error like *import 'wasi:...' has the wrong type*, you need a different version of Wasmtime. Currently this package targets [Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/releases/tag/v14.0.4). WASI 0.2 is now stable and so you shouldn't run into this as often.

### Referencing a WIT file

The whole point of the WASI 0.2 component model is to be able to interoperate across components. This is achieved using [WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT)](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md) files that specify data structures and functions to be imported or exported across components.

This package wraps `wit-bindgen` so that any `.wit` files in your project will automatically generate corresponding C# sources, allowing you to import or export functionality. **Caution:** wit-bindgen's support for C# is *extremely early* and many definitions do not yet work.

For example, add a file called `calculator.wit` into your project, containing:

```
package example:calculator;

interface operations {
  add: func(left: s32, right: s32) -> s32;
}

world computer {
  export operations;
}

world hostapp {
  import operations;
}
```

Before you can build, you'll now need to specify which *world* you're generating code for, i.e., choose whether you're importing or exporting functions.

#### Importing an implementation

One way to pick a world is by editing your `.csproj`, adding the following:

```xml
  <ItemGroup>
    <Wit Update="calculator.wit" World="hostapp" />
  </ItemGroup>
```

Another option, if you use Visual Studio, is to select the WIT file in *Solution Explorer*, and then look at the *Properties* pane:

![image](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/assets/1101362/86a204d1-985d-4d36-8bbd-5581375d989e)

You can simply type the world name `hostapp` into the properties pane.

For now, you must also specify the functions you want to import in the `.csproj` file.  Add this to the `ItemGroup`:

```xml
    <WasmImport Include="example:calculator/operations!add" />
```

Now you can call the imported `Add` function by putting the following in `Program.cs`:

```cs
using wit_hostapp.Wit.imports.example.calculator.Operations;

var result = OperationsInterop.Add(123, 456);
Console.WriteLine($"The result is {result}");
```

Since your component is no longer a self-contained application, you can no longer run it without also composing it with another WASI 0.2 component that implements the `add` function. To do that, either:

 * Create another .NET project and this time follow the steps for "exporting an implementation" below
 * Or, read docs for other platforms such as Rust or TinyGo, to implement a WASI component containing the implementation.

Once you have a component containing the implementation, you can use [wasm-tools](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools) to compose a runnable application:

```
wasm-tools compose -o composed.wasm MyApp.component.wasm -d AddImplementation.component.wasm
```

... then run it:

```
wasmtime --wasm component-model composed.wasm
```

#### Exporting an implementation

If you're **exporting** functionality, you'll be building a class library, not an executable. So be sure to go to your `.csproj` and change `<OutputType>` from `exe` to `library` and delete any `Program.cs`.

Once you've done that, change your WIT file to use the `calculator` world using one of the two techniques described above (i.e., either edit the `.csproj` or use the VS Properties pane).

Now when you build, you'll get an error like `The name 'OperationsImpl' does not exist in the current context`. This is because you've said you'll provide an implementation, but haven't yet done so. To fix this, add the following class to your project:

```cs
namespace wit_computer.Wit.exports.example.calculator.Operations;

public class OperationsImpl : Operations
{
    public static int Add(int left, int right)
    {
        return left + right;
    }
}
```

Make sure to get the namespace exactly correct! Although this is quite difficult to figure out at the moment, hopefully a future version of the C# support in wit-bindgen will make it easier.

Now when you build, you'll get a real WASI 0.2 component that exports an implementation for this WIT definition. You can confirm it using [wasm-tools](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools) by running:

```
wasm-tools component wit bin\Debug\net8.0\wasi-wasm\native\MyApp.component.wasm
```

Outputs:

```
package root:component;

world root {
  import ... various things ...

  export example:calculator/operations;
}
```

This component can be used anywhere that WASI 0.2 components can be used. For example, use `wasm-tools compose` as illustrated above.

### Referencing Wit Packages

By default the project will find all wit files and execute wit-bindgen against each one. This is makes it easy to get started with a single wit file.  If you have more complicated wit files, then you can create wit packages. To use folder with all the wit in it you can add the following to your `.csproj`. 

```xml
<ItemGroup>
    <Wit Remove="**\*.wit"  />
    <Wit Include="wit-folder" World="wit-world" /> 
</ItemGroup>
```

### WIT strings and memory

The calculator example above works easily because it doesn't need to allocate memory dynamically. Once you start working with strings, you must add an extra line to the `<PropertyGroup>` in your _host_ `.csproj` file (that is, the application that's _importing_ the interface):

```xml
    <IlcExportUnmanagedEntrypoints>true</IlcExportUnmanagedEntrypoints>
```

(You don't need to add this to your class library/exporting `.csproj`.)

If you get a build error along the lines of _failed to encode a component from module ... module does not export a function named `cabi_realloc`_ then check you have remembered to add this line.

This is a wrapper around various other bits of tooling:

 * [NativeAOT-LLVM](https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/tree/feature/NativeAOT-LLVM) for compilation.
 * [wit-bindgen](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen) for supporting WIT imports and exports
 * [wasm-tools](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools) for converting WebAssembly core modules into WASI 0.2 components.
 * [WASI SDK](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk) which is used by NativeAOT-LLVM.
   * Compatible versions of these will be downloaded and cached on your machine the first time you run a build, so the first build will take a few minutes. After that it will only take seconds.
